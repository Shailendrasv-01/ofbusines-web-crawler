# Web Crawler

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Installation
Install BeautifulSoup
Run python demo.py


## Note
Use python 3.10 or above
Api calling is used in api.py and the results are used in demo.py.
Commented section may take some time to run completely so I gathered the html from that code and then assigned it to the response so that it would run faster.
